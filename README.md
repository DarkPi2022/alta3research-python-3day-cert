# alta3research-python-3day-cert

Author: Jerry Mock

The alta3research-python3daycert01.py script is to convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit, and vice versa using conditions such as if and elif.

First, users are prompted to select the temperature unit in which they wish to convert from. Then, they will enter the temperature value. 
The script will then calculate the output and display the value with the correct unit.
